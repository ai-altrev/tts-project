# Current Project State

Last Updated: 2025-01-08

## Project Overview
This is a Text-to-Speech project with multiple model support, focused on processing and generating audio content from markdown documentation.

## Technical Implementation Status
- Audio Pipeline Implementation Complete:
  - setup_path.py (2.5MB): Main audio preprocessing pipeline
  - voice_prep.py (2.4KB): Voice-specific preprocessing
  - test_audio.py (1.7KB): Model comparison framework
  - test_unit.py (1.8KB): Core-specific testing
  - test_system.py (0.5KB): System integration tests
  - data_directory.py (1.2KB): File management utilities

## Model Integration Status
Currently testing three TTS models with sample outputs in /output/voice/:
1. Jenny model
   - Short sample: 377KB
   - Long sample: 1MB
2. L2Speech (Tacotron2+DDC)
   - Short sample: 488KB
   - Long sample: 532.2KB
3. Tortoise
   - Short sample: 237KB
   - Long sample: 772KB

## Active Development Areas
1. Model testing and comparison framework
2. Audio preprocessing pipeline optimization
3. Documentation processing system
4. Context continuity implementation

## Next Steps
1. Complete model evaluation
2. Optimize audio preprocessing
3. Implement automated testing
4. Document model performance comparisons

## Known Technical Limitations
1. Large file handling needs optimization
2. Processing pipeline requires manual intervention for certain edge cases
3. Model comparison metrics need standardization
