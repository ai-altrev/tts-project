Priority: Setting up model evaluation framework
- Define key performance metrics
- Create standardized test cases
- Implement automated comparison tools
- Design results visualization

## Conversation Starting Point
'Hi Claude, we're starting the model evaluation phase of the TTS project. We have three models integrated (Jenny, LJSpeech, Tortoise) and need to create a comprehensive evaluation framework. I'd like to begin by defining our evaluation metrics and test cases. What metrics should we prioritize for comparing TTS model performance?'
