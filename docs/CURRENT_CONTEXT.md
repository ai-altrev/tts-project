## Conversation Starting Point
'Hi Claude, we're continuing work on the TTS project. Based on our last session, we're now focusing on model evaluation and comparison. The three models (Jenny, LJSpeech, Tortoise) are integrated and ready for testing. What would you like to tackle first in the evaluation process?'
