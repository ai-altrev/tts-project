# Project History and Long-Term Context

## Project Overview
Text-to-Speech project with multiple model support, focused on processing and generating audio content from markdown documentation.

## Major Milestones Completed
1. Initial project setup with basic directory structure
2. Implementation of audio processing scripts
3. Integration of multiple TTS models (Jenny, LJSpeech, Tortoise)
4. Creation of testing framework

## Technical Implementation History

### Audio Pipeline Development
- setup_utils.py (2.5MB): Main audio preprocessing pipeline
- voice_prep.py (2.4KB): Voice-specific preprocessing
- test_audio.py (1.7KB): Model comparison framework
- test_voice.py (1.8KB): Cloud-specific testing
- test_system.py (858B): System integration tests
- data_directory.py (1.23KB): File management utilities

### Model Integration Progress
1. Jenny model integrated
   - Short sample: 377KB
   - Long sample: 1MB
2. LJSpeech implemented
   - Short sample: 532KB
   - Long sample: 3MB
3. Tortoise added
   - Short sample: 237KB
   - Long sample: 772KB

### Documentation Status
- 64 gate files processed
- File sizes range from 33.3KB to 48.3KB

## Known Technical Limitations
1. Large file handling needs optimization
2. Processing pipeline requires manual intervention for edge cases
3. Model comparison metrics need standardization

## Repository Structure
```
📁 tts-project/
  📁 config/           # Configuration files
  📁 data/            # Audio and transcription data
  📁 docs/            # Documentation files
  📁 models/          # TTS model files
  📁 outputs/         # Generated audio outputs
  📁 scripts/         # Processing and testing scripts
```

## Technical Decisions Made
1. Supporting multiple TTS models for comparison
2. Implementing separate preprocessing pipelines for different voice types
3. Creating standardized testing framework for model comparison
4. Structuring documentation with hierarchical gate system
