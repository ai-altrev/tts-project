## Current Status
Last Updated: 2025-01-08

### Project Overview
This is a Text-to-Speech project with multiple model support, focused on processing and generating audio content from markdown documentation.

### Current Focus Areas
- Model testing and comparison
- Audio preprocessing pipeline
- Documentation processing

### Recent Updates
1. Initial project setup completed
2. Basic audio processing scripts implemented
3. Multiple TTS models integrated (Jenny, LJSpeech, Tortoise)
4. Testing framework created

### Next Steps
- [ ] Complete model evaluation
- [ ] Optimize audio preprocessing
- [ ] Implement automated testing
- [ ] Document model performance comparisons

### Technical Implementation Status
- Audio Pipeline Status
  - Setup scripts implemented
  - Voice preprocessing in place
  - Model comparison framework ready
  - Testing system operational

### Known Technical Limitations
1. Large file handling needs optimization
2. Processing pipeline requires manual intervention for certain edge cases
3. Model comparison metrics need standardization
